# VisualArgumentProjectV2

My visual argument displays a message I have enthusiasm for which is visiting a dark sky outside the city for stargazing.

This time around I chose to create this in Affinity Photo rather than Gimp as I have experience using it so I found it much easier to get a satisfying result. I included the Affinity Photo file but since that may not be accessible, I included a screenshot of the layers used to create the visual argument. To remove the background of the galaxy I used the blend mode called "lighter," which is similar to the "screen" blend mode. 

The screenshot titled "TextGlow" shows the glow I created around the text. To do this, I duplicated the text layer and added a Gaussian blur to the background text.

The screenshot titled "LightPollutionEffect" uses a Gaussian blur on a triangle. I lowered the opacity of the triangle to let the stars be visible to create a light pollution effect. 

To clean up the graphic I used the inpainting tool to remove stars that were visible in the silhouette of Pittsburgh.
